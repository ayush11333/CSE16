# Hello World Program 

'#include' is a preprocessor directive → it tells the compiler to include another file before compilation.

<stdio.h> = Standard Input Output Header file.

It contains the declarations (function prototypes, macros, types) for input/output functions like:

printf() → for printing output.

scanf() → for reading input.
